# Project BST

This repository complements the [Project BST](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-bst) in the Ruby Course for The Odin Project. The goal of this project is to reimplement common methods used frequently through the BST data structure such as insert, delete, and search. This project will also familiarize you with how to work with blocks and procs. Some starter code and specs are provided to validate the correctness of your solutions.
